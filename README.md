# URI::Template [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanstowe/URI-Template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanstowe/URI-Template)

Implementation of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570 for Perl 6

## Synopsis

```

use URI::Template;

my $template = URI::Template.new(template => 'http://foo.com{/foo,bar}');

say $template.process(foo => 'baz', bar => 'quux'); # http://foo.com/baz/quux

```

## Description

This provides an implementation of
[RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) which allows for the
definition of a URI through variable expansion.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working perl6 installation you should be able to
install this with *panda* :

    # From the source directory
   
    panda install .

    # Remote installation

    panda install URI::Template

I haven't tested this with "zef" but I see no reason why it shouldn't work.

## Support

Suggestions/patches are welcomed via github at

   https://github.com/jonathanstowe/URI-Template

The test data covers all of the examples given in the RFC and a few others,
if you think the behaviour is incorrect please state the section of the RFC
and provide a failing example with the required variables, template and the
expected output.
